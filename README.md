# asleeper-rblxrpc
asleeper-rblxrpc is a modified version of cosmental's Roblox-RPC which can be found on the [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/roblox-rpc-roblox-rich-presence-for-discord/2047129) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Cosmental/Roblox-RPC#readme) respective pages.

## Installation
To get asleeper-rblxrpc, download the latest zip file and unzip it. Inside of the folder there will be a directory named "main", go to that directory and there will be 2 files; main.js and configuration.js. Open configuration.js in a text editor like notepad and add your [.ROBLOSECURITY cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg/related) and [Discord Developer Portal application client ID](https://support.heateor.com/discord-client-id-discord-client-secret/).

After confirming your input in the configuration file and making sure to save, download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't already have it. Next, open up command prompt. In command prompt, copy the path to the asleeper-rblxrpc folder containing all of the files (not the .zip if you still have it) and run `cd [path]` After running the command in command prompt, run `node .` If you see a text saying that asleeper-RBLXRPC is running, it should be working. Head to your discord profile and if it doesn't display anything, try joining a game and checking afterwards. Enjoy!
